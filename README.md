## What's different from upstream?

**Compatibility:**
- Apple Silicon (MPS) support: `boltz predict --accelerator mps`
- Dependency pins relaxed from `==` to `>=`
- `fairscale` dependency removed — replaced with PyTorch built-in `torch.utils.checkpoint`
- `numpy<2.0` cap removed
- `requires-python` widened to `>=3.10` (removed `<3.13` cap)
- Compatible with PyTorch 2.6+ and Lightning 2.6+

- Fixed potential stack overflow in training/validation data loading via bounded retry (max 10 attempts)
- Fixed `boltz predict` exiting silently with code 0 when all inputs fail validation (e.g. requesting affinity for a protein chain)
- Fixed MSA pairing keys lost when loading cached A3M files ([#627](https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz/issues/627))
- Fixed consecutive CA filter rejecting valid protein chains containing metal ions ([#576](https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz/pull/576))

- Fixed Boltz-2 checkpoint loading crash due to extra `mse_rotational_alignment` kwarg ([#644](https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz/issues/644))
- Fixed empty checkpoint files causing cryptic `load_from_checkpoint` aborts — now re-downloads empty cached weights and raises a clear error before model load ([#664](https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz/issues/664))
- Fixed CPU inference producing distorted structures with wrong bond lengths — Boltz-2 was incorrectly using `bf16-mixed` precision on CPU; now forces float32 ([#653](https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz/issues/653))
- Fixed diffusion sampling ignoring `--max_parallel_samples` in divisible cases (for example `10` samples with a parallel limit of `5`), which could batch everything into one large chunk and trigger avoidable OOMs
- Fixed MSA discarded as "does not match input sequence" when pre-computed MSAs are aligned to a full UniProt sequence but the input uses a shorter PDB construct — Boltz now finds the construct as a contiguous subsequence within the MSA query and trims all MSA rows accordingly, instead of falling back to a dummy single-sequence MSA. Tolerates up to 5% mismatches (selenomethionine substitutions, expression tags, minor construct mutations). Applies to both Boltz-1 and Boltz-2.

**Improvements:**
- Added `--skip_bad_inputs` flag: by default `boltz predict` now aborts when any input fails processing; pass `--skip_bad_inputs` to skip bad inputs and continue with the rest
- Deferred heavy imports (torch, rdkit, pytorch-lightning) so `boltz.main` loads instantly for CLI help and input validation
- `--devices` now accepts a comma-separated list of specific GPU device IDs in addition to a device count (e.g. `--devices 0,1` targets GPUs 0 and 1; use `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 boltz predict ...` to target a single GPU by index)

**Performance improvements:**
- Model weights now load directly to GPU instead of CPU-then-transfer
- Cached molecule file reads and symmetry deserialization across samples
- Removed dead O(n_tokens × n_chains) loop in pocket distance computation
- Tensors across model modules now allocated directly on device instead of CPU-then-transfer ([#654](https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz/pull/654))
- Featurizer MSA pairing fill rewritten with vectorized numpy indexing (eliminates per-row Python loop)
- `process_atom_features` pre-allocates output arrays and fills `atom_to_token` in one slice per token (eliminates per-atom appends)

**Tests & CI:**
- 190+ tests: unit tests (CPU), smoke tests (end-to-end inference), regression tests (golden output verification for Boltz-1 and Boltz-2), determinism tests, MSA trim subsequence matching (8 cases), diffusion chunking regression tests, and featurizer pre-allocation correctness
- GitHub Actions CI with CPU runners (every push/PR) and GPU T4 runners (push to main)

Pull requests are welcome! If you have a bug fix, test improvement, or compatibility enhancement, please open a PR.

## Installation

Install from GitHub:

```
pip install "boltz-community @ git+https://github.com/Novel-Therapeutics/boltz-community.git"
```

With CUDA kernels:

```
pip install "boltz-community[cuda] @ git+https://github.com/Novel-Therapeutics/boltz-community.git"
```

If you are installing on CPU-only or non-CUDA GPU hardware, use the first command without `[cuda]`. Note that the CPU version is significantly slower than the GPU version.

### Apple Silicon (MPS)

On Macs with Apple Silicon, you can run inference on the GPU via MPS:

```
boltz predict input.yaml --accelerator mps --use_msa_server
```

MPS mode automatically uses float32 precision and single-device execution. Performance is slower than CUDA but significantly faster than CPU.

## Introduction

Boltz is a family of models for biomolecular interaction prediction. Boltz-1 was the first fully open source model to approach AlphaFold3 accuracy. Our latest work Boltz-2 is a new biomolecular foundation model that goes beyond AlphaFold3 and Boltz-1 by jointly modeling complex structures and binding affinities, a critical component towards accurate molecular design. Boltz-2 is the first deep learning model to approach the accuracy of physics-based free-energy perturbation (FEP) methods, while running 1000x faster — making accurate in silico screening practical for early-stage drug discovery.

All the code and weights are provided under MIT license, making them freely available for both academic and commercial uses. For more information about the model, see the [Boltz-1](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.19.624167) and [Boltz-2](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.14.659707) technical reports. To discuss updates, tools and applications join our [Slack channel](https://boltz.bio/join-slack).

## Inference

You can run inference using Boltz with:

```
boltz predict input_path --use_msa_server
```

`input_path` should point to a YAML file, or a directory of YAML files for batched processing, describing the biomolecules you want to model and the properties you want to predict (e.g. affinity). To see all available options: `boltz predict --help` and for more information on these input formats, see our [prediction instructions](docs/prediction.md). By default, the `boltz` command will run the latest version of the model.


### Binding Affinity Prediction
There are two main predictions in the affinity output: `affinity_pred_value` and `affinity_probability_binary`. They are trained on largely different datasets, with different supervisions, and should be used in different contexts. The `affinity_probability_binary` field should be used to detect binders from decoys, for example in a hit-discovery stage. Its value ranges from 0 to 1 and represents the predicted probability that the ligand is a binder. The `affinity_pred_value` aims to measure the specific affinity of different binders and how this changes with small modifications of the molecule. This should be used in ligand optimization stages such as hit-to-lead and lead-optimization. It reports a binding affinity value as `log10(IC50)`, derived from an `IC50` measured in `μM`. More details on how to run affinity predictions and parse the output can be found in our [prediction instructions](docs/prediction.md).

## Authentication to MSA Server

When using the `--use_msa_server` option with a server that requires authentication, you can provide credentials in one of two ways. More information is available in our [prediction instructions](docs/prediction.md#authentication-to-msa-server).
 
## Training

⚠️ **Coming soon: updated training code for Boltz-2!**

If you're interested in retraining the model, currently for Boltz-1 but soon for Boltz-2, see our [training instructions](docs/training.md).


## Contributing

We welcome external contributions and are eager to engage with the community. Connect with us on our [Slack channel](https://boltz.bio/join-slack) to discuss advancements, share insights, and foster collaboration around Boltz-2.

On recent NVIDIA GPUs, Boltz leverages the acceleration provided by [NVIDIA  cuEquivariance](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuequivariance) kernels. Boltz also runs on Tenstorrent hardware thanks to a [fork](https://github.com/moritztng/tt-boltz) by Moritz Thüning.
